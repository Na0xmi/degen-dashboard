Gm, 

This dashboard is built with Claude by someone who's coding skills are minimal. So excuse any weird code, it was crowd wisdom ðŸ˜¹

It uses Dexscreener API for price data, and Tatum for the rest of onchain data. Tatum API gives you 1 million requests for free so not a bad deal. 

Anyway, the hat stays on. ðŸŽ©
